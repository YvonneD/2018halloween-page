            <p>These days, Halloween is all about dressing up, carving pumpkins and eating your body weight in sweets.
                <br>
                But did you know centuries ago, Halloween was actually the best night to find your future husband?
                <br><br />
                In 18th-century Ireland, matchmaking cooks used to hide a ring inside mashed potatoes, in the hope of bringing true love to the diner who found it - and didn't swallow it, hopefully.

                Meanwhile, in Scotland, single young women would name a hazelnut after each of their potential suitors, before tossing them in the fire. Legend had it that if the nut burned to ashes, rather than popping, it represented the new husband.</p>

            <p>Rather confusingly though, other legends dictated that if the hazelnut turned to ashes, it meant the marriage wouldn't last, but who's being picky?

                Another ritual saw young women toss apple peels over their shoulders, hoping they would shape their soulmate's initials as they fell to the ground.
                <br>
                Obviously, food was a key matchmaker, as some women ate a 'potion' of walnuts, hazelnuts and nutmeg before bed on Halloween, so they could dream about their future husbands.

                Other romantic superstitions included standing in front of mirrors in darkened rooms, holding candles and looking over your shoulder to see your love's face, or winning the apple-bobbing contest - meaning you'd get married first.
